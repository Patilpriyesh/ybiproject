In this case, for class 0, the precision is 0.46, which means that out of all the instances predicted as class 0, 46% of them were actually class 0.

In this case, for class 0, the recall is 0.22, which means that only 22% of all the actual class 0 instances were correctly predicted as class 0. For class 1, the recall is 0.77, indicating that 77% of the actual class 1 instances were correctly predicted as class 1.\n",

    "The weighted average considers the contributions of each class based on their support (the number of instances in each class). It's weighted by the number of instances in each class, so classes with more instances have a greater impact on the average."

The F1-scores provide a balanced view of the model's performance, with class 1 having a higher F1-score, suggesting better overall performance for that class. Overall accuracy is relatively low at 51%, indicating that the model's performance may need improvement, especially in terms of precision and recall for class 0."
